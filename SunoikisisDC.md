#### Summary

The session aims to give an humanities-friendly overview about a distant reading method called topic-modelling and its application to morphologically complex languages (e.g. Latin, Ancient Greek, Classical Arabic). It is divided into five sections. In the first section the session provides a short introduction of LDA Topic Modelling and then it presents its application in language teaching. Thirdly, it sheds light onto the challenges of topic modelling complex languages and demonstrates its execution on a bigger Latin corpus. In the last section a graphical user interface is presented to the audience that enables users to topic model any text without coding. While the tool can be used in any language, Latin and Greek texts in a valid CTS format are supported best.

#### Outline

- Short Introduction to Topic Modelling
- The Use of Topic Modelling Results in Teaching
- The Challenges of Topic Modelling Historical Languages
- Use Case: Topic Modelling 30 Million Words of Latin
- Introduction to (Melete) ToPan: A Topic Modelling GUI for Scholars

#### Practical exercise: Using ToPan
 
1. Download and install [ToPan](https://github.com/ThomasK81/ToPan) and its dependencies (more on the link).
2. Start it up.
3. Ingest data (e.g. https://github.com/ThomasK81/ToPan/blob/master/caesar.csv or https://github.com/ThomasK81/ToPan/blob/master/Petronius.csv)
4. If the data is in Latin or Greek, use morphologically normalisation.
5. Run a topic model and explore the results.
